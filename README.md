Homotopy Type Theory in Agda
============================

Introduction
------------

This repository contains a development of homotopy type theory and univalent
foundations in Agda.  The structure of the source code is described below.

Agda Options
------------

This library is assuming the options `--universe-polymorphism` (on by default)
and the experimental one ``.

Style and naming conventions
----------------------------

### General

- Line length should be reasonably short, not much more than 80 characters
  (TODO: except maybe sometimes for equational reasoning?)
- Directories are in lowercase and modules are in CamelCase
- Types are Capitalized unless they represent properties (like `is-prop`)
- Terms are in lowercase-with-hyphens-between-words
- Try to avoid names of free variables in identifiers

### Identity type

The identity type is `_==_`, because `_=_` is not allowed in Agda. For every
identifier talking about the identity type, the single symbol `=` is used
instead, because this is allowed by Agda. For instance the introduction rule for
the identity type of Σ-types is `pair=` and not `pair==`.

### Truncation levels

The numbering is the homotopy-theoretic numbering, parametrized by the type
`TLevel` or `ℕ₋₂` where

    data TLevel : Type₀ where
      ⟨-2⟩ : TLevel
      S : TLevel → TLevel

    ℕ₋₂ = TLevel

There are also terms `⟨-1⟩`, `⟨0⟩`, `⟨1⟩`, `⟨2⟩` and `⟨_⟩ : ℕ → ℕ₋₂` with the
obvious definitions.

### Properties of types

Names of the form `is-X` or `has-X`, represent properties that can hold (or not)
for some type `A`. Such a property can be parametrized by some arguments. The
property is said to hold for a type `A` iff `is-X args A` is inhabited. The
types `is-X args A` should be (h-)propositions.

Examples:

    is-contr
    is-prop
    is-set
    has-level       -- This one has one argument of type [ℕ₋₂]
    has-all-paths   -- Every two points are equal
    has-dec-eq      -- Decidable equality

- The theorem stating that some type `A` (perhaps with arguments) has some
  property `is-X` is named `A-is-X`. The arguments of `A-is-X` are the arguments
  of `is-X` followed by the arguments of `A`.
- Theorems stating that any type satisfying `is-X` also satisfies `is-Y` are
  named `X-is-Y` (and not `is-X-is-Y` which would mean `is-Y (is-X A)`).

Examples (only the nonimplicit arguments are given)

    Unit-is-contr : is-contr Unit
    Bool-is-set : is-set Bool
    is-contr-is-prop : is-contr (is-prop A)
    contr-is-prop : is-contr A → is-prop A
    dec-eq-is-set : has-dec-eq A → is-set A
    contr-has-all-paths : is-contr A → has-all-paths A

The term giving the most natural truncation level to some type constructor T is
called `T-level`:

    Σ-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → (has-level n A) → ((x : A) → has-level n (P x))
           → has-level n (Σ A P)
    ×-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → (has-level n A) → (has-level n B)
           → has-level n (A × B))
    Π-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → ((x : A) → has-level n (P x))
           → has-level n (Π A P)
    →-level : (n : ℕ₋₂) → (has-level n B)
           → has-level n (A → B))

### Functions and equivalences

- A natural function between two types `A` and `B` is often called `A-to-B`
- If `f : A → B`, the lemma asserting that `f` is an equivalence is called
  `f-is-equiv`
- If `f : A → B`, the equivalence `(f , f-is-equiv)` is called `f-equiv`
- As a special case of the previous point, `A-to-B-equiv` is usually called
  `A-equiv-B` instead

We have

    A-to-B : A → B
    A-to-B-is-equiv : is-equiv (A-to-B)
    A-to-B-equiv : A ≃ B
    A-equiv-B : A ≃ B

### Negative types

The constructor of a record should usually be the uncapitalized name of the
record. If `N` is a negative type (for instance a record) with introduction
rule `n` and elimination rules `e1`, …, `en`, then

- The identity type on `N` is called `N=`
- The intros and elim rules for the identity type on `N` are called `n=` and
  `e1=`, …, `en=`
- If necessary, the double identity type is called `N==` and similarly for the
  intros and elim.
- The β-elimination rules for the identity type on `N` are called `e1=-β`, …,
  `en=-β`.
- The η-expansion rule is called `n=-η` (TODO: maybe `N=-η` instead, or
  additionally?)
- The equivalence/path between `N=` and `_==_ {N}` is called
- `N=-equiv`/`N=-path` (TODO: `n=-equiv`/`n=-path` would maybe be more natural).
   Note that this equivalence is usually needed in the direction `N= ≃ _==_ {N}`

Structure of the source
-----------------------

The structure of the source is roughly the following:

### Old library (directory `old/`)

The old library is still present, mainly to facilitate code transfer to the new
library. Once everything has been ported to the new library, this directory will
be removed.

### Library (directory `lib/`)

The main library is more or less divided in three parts.

- The first part is exported in the module `lib.Basics` and contains everything
  needed to make the second part compile
- The second part is exported in the module `lib.types.Types` and contains
  everything you ever wanted to know about all type formers
- The third part contains more advanced stuff.

The whole library is exported in the file `HoTT`, so every file using the
library should contain `open import HoTT`.

TODO: describe more precisely each file

### Homotopy (directory `homotopy/`)

This directory contains proofs of interesting homotopy-theoretic theorems.

TODO: describe more precisely each file

### Experimental (directory `experimental/`)

This directory contains experimental things (as you can guess).
