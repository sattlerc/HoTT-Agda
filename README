This code base contains the accompanying code to the article

  "On the Hierarchy of Univalent Universes: U(n) is not n-Truncated"

and all of its dependencies. It has been verified to typecheck
with the latest Agda release as of 14/11/2012, version 2.3.2.2.


Contents
========

The subdirectory 'Universe' contains our Agda developments implementing
the contents of the above article. The code is extensively documented
and should be self-explanatory. The reader is invited to start with
the entry point 'Universe/index.agda', which establishes correspondence
of sections of the article with individual modules.

The subdirectory 'lib' contains a slightly modified portion of the 2.0 branch
of the HoTT community's Agda library. For readability and verifiability,
we decided to include only those parts that are required to typecheck
the actual code implementing the development of the article.

The only notable use of a postulate occurs in 'lib/types/Truncation'
to emulate a higher inductive type, the n-truncation, in Agda using
Dan Licata's "trick" of a partially private definition (note that
Agda does not currently support higher inductive types natively).
This file is important at the very end of our development when we
want to compare our "internal" notions of connectedness to the
standard one derived from truncations in the theory.

The subdirectory 'html' contains a browser-readable interactive version
of the source code generatable by 'agda Universe/index.agda --html'.


How to typecheck
================

Since this development lead to the discovery of a number of small bugs in
the typechecking mechanism of Agda, we recommend an installation of the most
current release of Agda, version 2.3.2.2. Future versions of Agda (2.4 and
higher) are expected to predefine their own universe level type and would
hence be compatible only with a small change to 'lib/Base.agda'.

The entry point 'Universe/index.agda' imports all of the files of our
developments. It is hence enough to run 'agda Universe/index.agda'
within the working directory this README file is residing in. The flag
"--without-K" required to make Agda compatible with homotopy type theory
is given in the header of each individual file, so it is not necessary
to include it as a command line parameter. Execution of the above command
should result in a final output line "Finished Universe.index" with no errors,
unresolved meta-variables or outstanding termination checks.
